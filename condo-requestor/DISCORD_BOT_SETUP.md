    "token": "YOUR_ACTUAL_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
    "clientId": "YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID_HERE",

# How the Bot Works

## File Management System

The bot manages Roblox game files in your `games` folder:

1. **File Detection**: Automatically finds .rbxlx and .rbxl files
2. **Modern Interface**: Shows dropdown menu with formatted names
3. **File Information**: Displays size, date, and type for each game

## Generation Process

When someone uses `/generate`:

1. **Selection Menu**: Shows all available game files in a dropdown
2. **File Selection**: User picks a game from the menu
3. **Public Announcement**: Sends a fancy embed to the channel announcing generation
4. **Private Details**: Sends detailed file info privately to the requester

## What Actually Happens

The bot creates a realistic simulation of game generation but does NOT upload files to Roblox. This is because:
- Roblox requires manual authentication
- Automated uploads violate platform terms
- Publishing needs Roblox Studio or roblox.com
