- Avoid spaces, use underscores: `cool_game.rbxlx`
- Bot will format names automatically: "Cool Game"

## Part 5: Roblox Integration Notes

**Important:** This bot does NOT automatically upload games to Roblox. Here's what it does:

### What the Bot Does:
- Shows dropdown menu with your game files
- Creates "generation" announcements when someone selects a game
- Sends private file details to the requester
- Manages and organizes your local game files

### For Actual Roblox Publishing:
1. Use bot to select which game to work with
2. Download/access the selected .rbxlx file
3. Open file in Roblox Studio
4. Publish manually through Roblox Studio's publishing tools

### Why No Auto-Upload:
- Roblox requires manual authentication through their website
- Automated uploads would violate Roblox's terms of service
- Publishing requires Roblox Studio or manual upload

## Part 6: Testing Your Bot

### Step 1: Verify Bot is Online
Check hosting platform logs for:
- "âœ… Loaded command: generate"
- "âœ… Successfully reloaded application (/) commands"
- "ðŸ¤– Bot is ready! Logged in as [Bot Name]"

### Step 2: Test Commands
1. Go to your Discord server
2. Type `/generate`
3. Should see dropdown menu with your games
4. Select a game to test generation

### Step 3: Check Functionality
- Public announcement appears in channel
- Private details sent to you
- No error messages in console

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
- Check DISCORD_TOKEN is correct in secrets
- Verify bot has proper permissions in server
- Wait 5-10 minutes for commands to register

### No Games Showing
- Upload .rbxlx or .rbxl files to games folder
- Check file extensions are correct
- Restart bot after adding files

### Permission Errors
- Verify bot role has required permissions
- Check bot role is above @everyone in hierarchy
- Re-invite bot with correct permissions
